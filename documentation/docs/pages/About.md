# About

My name is Jo√£o Medeiros, I am currently a student of systems analysis and development. In my spare time, I set out to create this open source technology to contribute to the API Rest development community, the purpose of this application is not to try to plagiarize the application of the same segment, I had difficulties with this type of segment and was looking for something that was online and could work as a crud, with teamwork and could embed my documentation, then Api Doc was born

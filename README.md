Api doc is a CRUD api documenter, this system is part of my personal portfolio, but it was born out of a need to document my APIs and test it on one platform, any resemblance to swagger, insomnia or postman is not a conscience, I love it these applications and I was inspired by them to do the research needed to build "Api Doc"
